Real-time hydro generation output from Cyd Ynni hydro in North Wales, UK

Cyd Ynni : Ynni Lleol is a community project linking up households with local community hydro power projects. Working together, we can help you benefit from cheaper electricity (a potential saving of 10-30%) and support your local renewable energy generators. We have 100 households to be part of our first trial in Bethesa, North Wales UK.
